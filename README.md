Original Hypothesis
•	Wanted to see if playing the combo game in the Pick 3 Va Lottery there is a arbitrage opportunity

Pick Three Lottery Research and Findings
•	There is no arbitrage opportunity using the combo game
•	If you “covered the board” you would lose money
•	There are approx. 1,000 permutations of 3 digit numbers from 0-9 and this does not include trips – which explains why you would lose money
